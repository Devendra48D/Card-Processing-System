# Card-Processing-System

##Design Decisions
I used Python and implemented the database as a dictionary to decrease lookup or query time.

Use a simple if-else structure to reading each command and perform operations on a database as per the instructions provided

##Why I chose Python?
————————————————————
I chose Python as the programming language to write this solution because I am most comfortable using Python to solve a problem. 

##Instructions: How to run the code and/or install any dependencies?
———————————————————————————————————————————————————— 
1) Install Python 2.7 on your computer. No extra packages or libraries are needed. All the functions and libraries that are used in my program are in Python 2.7.
2) Go to the folder where this solution is stored through terminal. 
3) Run the command ‘python cardps.py testfile.txt’ to check the output for testfile.txt.
4) If the command ‘python cardps.py < testfile.txt’ does not work, try ‘python cardps.py \< testfile.txt’. This depends on the terminal or Operating system. 
5) The expected outputs for the files test.txt and testfile.txt are in ‘results for test.txt’ and ‘results for testfile.txt’ respectively. 

Thank You!
